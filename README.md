Welcome to my portfolio!

i made this to show what i am capable of as well as show off specific projects that i have worked on and will continue to update!

i flexed my coding muscles by making this in react! and making a little call out page for who i am how to contact me and other little nifty things about me

react is wonderful to work in, it may be a little confusing at times when using certain methods of SRC and other calls but after working out some kinks i have come to enjoy this tech a lot!
