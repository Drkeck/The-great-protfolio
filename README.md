# [Dr Keck's Portfolio]() 

![image of site](https://i.imgur.com/Oike0Vr.png)

Welcome to my portfolio!

i made this to show what i am capable of as well as show off specific projects that i have worked on and will continue to update!

i flexed my coding muscles by making this in react! and making a little call out page for who i am how to contact me and other little nifty things about me

react is wonderful to work in, it may be a little confusing at times when using certain methods of SRC and other calls but after working out some kinks i have come to enjoy this tech a lot!

## Tools Used :

* React

* ReactStrap

* Css

* Javascript

* many, many, tutorials, trial and errors, and messing with the CSS to make sure things fit properly.


## About Me :

Well why are you looking here? why not look at the small introduction i made on the site?

im always looking to improve and love feedback!
